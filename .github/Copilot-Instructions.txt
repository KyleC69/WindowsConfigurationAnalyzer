Application: Windows Configuration Analyzer

Description: A tool to analyze Windows systems configuration and report anomalous or configuration errors. Will also scan for security vulnerabilities and report om findings..
Instructions: Use the documents in the analyzer/docs folder as a blueprint for the analyzer library in this repo.

Solution Structure:
- Analyzer/ - Main library project for Windows Configuration Analyzer. -Current Focus-
  - Docs/ - Documentation files for the analyzer library.
- UserInterface/ - Will contain User Interface, WinuUI 3 based .net 9.0 project.
- UserInterface.Core/ - Contains core logic for the User Interface.
- Tests/ - Unit and integration tests for the analyzer library and UI components.

Gaurdrails: *ENFORCED*
- Interface project must use WinuUI 3 and target .net 9.0. Analyzer library must be modular and extensible for future analyzers. 
- Follow best practices for security and performance in all code.
- User interface projects (Interface and Interface.Core) were created with TemplateStudio and must follow its conventions. Do not break existing patterns established by TemplateStudio.
- Do Not remove or alter any existing documentation files in the analyzer/docs folder unless directed to do so.
- Do Not remove or alter any exiting comments in the codebase unless directed to do so. 
- Do not apply any formatting or stylistic changes to existing code unless directed to do so. User will intiate such requests separately.
- Ensure all new code is well-documented and follows existing documentation standards in the analyzer/docs folder
- Keep Analyzer library purely focused on analysis logic. Do not introduce any UI elements or dependencies into the Analyzer project.
